# 📊 Animation Examples – glze

This folder contains usage examples and demos for the **core/animation** module of the glze engine.  
Each example illustrates how to create, manipulate, and play animations using the AnimationClip, AnimationMixer, and KeyframeTrack system.

---

## 📂 Examples

### 🔹 basicClip.js
Demonstrates creating a simple animation clip and playing it on a 3D object.

### 🔹 morphTargets.js
Shows how to animate morph target sequences, useful for facial expressions or shape transformations.

### 🔹 skeletal.js
Illustrates skeletal animation with bones and hierarchical structures, using VectorKeyframeTrack and QuaternionKeyframeTrack.

### 🔹 blending.js
Covers blending multiple animation clips together using different blend modes (Normal vs Additive).

## 📝 Notes
- These examples assume you have a working 3D scene with objects already loaded.
- Examples are modular; you can import just the AnimationClip or AnimationMixer as needed.
- KeyframeTracks are type-specific: Vector, Quaternion, Number, Color, Boolean, and String.
- Designed to give practical, hands-on understanding of glze's animation system before integrating with scenes or game logic.
